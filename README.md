Welcome to our game Monster Mayhem!!


Pay attention!!HERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS:
Each round, the player with the fewest monsters on the grid gets a turn first.
If there is a tie, then it is randomly decided from among those with the least monsters.
On a players turn, they may play either a dracula, a werewolf or a ghost anywhere on their edge of the grid.
They may not move that monster this turn. They may also move any other monsters that they have.
A monster can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, or up to two squares diagonally.
They can move over their own player’s monsters, but cannot move over other player’s monsters.

Rules:
If there’s a dracula and a werewolf, the werewolf is removed!
If there’s a werewolf and a ghost, the ghost is removed!
If there’s a ghost and a dracula, the dracula is removed!
If there’s two of the same kind of monster, both are removed!
